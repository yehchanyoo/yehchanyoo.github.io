# Welcome to my portfolio website!

<img src="yehchan_yoo_profile_pic.jpeg">

My name is Yeh Chan Yoo; I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Berkeley, having studied Statistics and Political Economy + minored in Data Science as an undergraduate! I graduated on December 25.

This website was built to host some of the research work I have done in the last several years; I sincerely hope you enjoy reading and interacting with my work!

(The work I have below is arranged by creation date from most recent to least recent.)

## [Inference and Prediction on Crude Diabetes Prevalence in U.S. States Based on Vegetable Consumption](DATA_C102_Project_Final_Project_Submission__CD_TE_CM_YY___230512_.pdf)

This paper was written in collaboration with my classmates [Christina Đặng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christina-%C4%91%E1%BA%B7ng/), [Conan Minihan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/conanminihan/), and [Tetsuro Escudero](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tetsuro-escudero-542a93219/) as the final project report for DATA 102: Data, Inference, and Decisions, taught by [Mr. Ramesh Sridharan](https://www.rameshvs.com/) and [Professor Eaman Jahani](https://eamanjahani.com/) for the Spring 2023 semester.  This paper attempts to use inferential and predictive techniques to look at the relationship between vegetable consumption and crude diabetes prevalence in American states and predict diabetes prevalence based on vegetable consumption.

## [Replication and Improvement on "How do 401(k)s Affect Saving? Evidence from Change in 401(k) Eligibility"](group04_YY_XZ.pdf)

This paper was written in collaboration with my classmate [Xinyi Zi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xinyi-zi/) as the final project paper for STAT 156: Causal Inference, taught by [Professor Peng Ding](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/peng-ding) for the Fall 2022 semester. This paper attempts to explore, replicate, critique, and re-do [Professor Alexander M. Gelber](https://gps.ucsd.edu/faculty-directory/alexander-gelber.html)'s 2011 causal inference paper ["How Do 401(k)s Affect Saving? Evidence from Changes in 401(k) Eligibility"](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.3.4.103).

## [Effects of International Monetary Fund's Financial Crisis Policy Program in the Republic of Korea](pe101_term_paper.pdf)

This paper was written as my term paper for POLECON 101: Contemporary Theories of Political Economy, taught by [Mr. Khalid Kadir](https://blumcenter.berkeley.edu/academics/gppminor/faculty/kadir/) for the Fall 2022 semester. Using some of the complex political economy theories taught in this course, this paper explores the political economy perspective of how the International Monetary Fund's program in response to South Korea's financial crisis in the late 1990s affected South Korean society in the short, medium, and long run.

## [Transit and Housing in California](https://deepnote.com/@berkeley-datathon-fall-2022-project/Presentation-3aa74663-1377-4af5-9f38-92009ab3c36b) 

This article was made within 3 days for the Fall 2022 UC Berkeley Datathon for Social Good and won second place in the Urban Studies track. For this article, my Datathon team (consisting of [Gain Boonavich](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gainsira/), [Anita Ding](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anita-ding-530238225/), [Yixin Huang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yixin-huang-91b7781aa/), and myself) used Python to perform linear regression and create data visualizations to dive into the relationship between the amount of investment in transit and the number of housing units in Californian counties.

I served in the Republic of Korea Air Force as a translator sergeant from 2020 to 2022 -- translating various government, legal, mechanical, and logistics documents (from Korean to English and from English to Korean) to facilitate smooth communication on logistical issues between the Republic of Korea Air Force and various foreign arms manufacturers.

## [SAAS x Trace Data](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12Q5RciThBbhEOnpQ-6ASKT7Fe_ZnnH4NoDMHMqB73cE/edit?usp=sharing)

During the Fall 2019 semester, as a member of the Data Consulting committee in the Student Association for Applied Statistics (SAAS), I worked in a team to create our own JSON key-value pair classification systems using machine learning and natural language processing models with data provided by a startup named Trace Data (later acquired by [Netskope](https://www.netskope.com/)). More specifically, I worked with [Amal Bhatnagar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amal-bhatnagar/) to create an unsupervised clustering algorithm using tf-idf as the main metric.

## [Meaning of Probabilities in Social Sciences](/susa_research_yy_fall_2018.html)

As a declared Statistics major interested in social sciences, I often found that probability was used a lot in social science research. But I often wondered: *what do these probabilities fundamentally mean?* I wrote an article on the meaning of probabilities in social sciences to help answer this question during my time as a member of the Research and Publication Committee in Statistics Undergraduate Student Association (now called SAAS or Student Association for Applied Statistics).

## [Analyzing Undergraduate Statistics Majors’ Preparation in Communication with Non-Statisticians in the University of California, Berkeley](/statistics_communication_paper/Yoo_Yehchan_Spring2018_CompleteResearchPaper.pdf)

Assessing the preparation of undergraduate statistics majors in statistical writing for non-statisticians at the University of California, Berkeley, revealed a significant gap. Despite substantial training in statistical writing within major classes, students lacked practical experience communicating with non-statisticians. Interviews with professors indicated a hesitancy to enforce stricter writing requirements, citing resource constraints and a desire for program growth. However, the findings underscored the pressing need for increased resources devoted to statistical writing education within the Department of Statistics. This project was written for my final project for the COLWRIT R4B class on discourse conventions in various academic fields.

## [Is there a statistical relationship between a region’s legalization of euthanasia and that region’s suicide rate?](https://saas.berkeley.edu/rp/suicide)

Statistical analysis of data from Mexico indicates that the legalization of passive euthanasia in certain Mexican regions likely is unrelated to the Mexican regions’ raw suicide rates in the short run. Difference-in-difference analysis on data from the Netherlands (and Norway) indicates that, while major events towards the legalization of active and passive euthanasia may have had a decreasing short-run impact on the raw suicide rate of the Netherlands, such effect -- if present -- likely became diluted over time.

## [Philosophy of Human Rights](/philosophy_of_human_rights/philosophy_of_human_rights.pptx)

This presentation was created to teach members of Amnesty International at Berkeley about the philosophical meaning and questions behind the concept of human rights during my time in the organization.

## [Focicle2020's Fun Proof-O-Pedia](https://www.geogebra.org/material/show/id/zYqyyRXD)

In this GeoGebra book, I have gathered up the GeoGebra applets I made in my free time to help others understand the workings of certain mathematical concepts and -- most importantly -- to teach them to have fun with math! I hope that people will enjoy my GeoGebra applets!

This collection of personally made interactive GeoGebra templates contains demonstrations for finding the area of a circle, proving the Pythagorean Theorem, proving the Power of a Point, etc.
